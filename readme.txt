= How do I use the widget? =

Go to the Appearance menu, and open the Widgets submenu. There you will find the widget under the title 'ShowMeTheStickiesInTheCat'. 

= How do I make my posts sticky? =
1. After you have written your post, scroll down to the area titled Custom Fields.
Note: As of WordPress version 3.1, some [screen options](http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Screen_Options) on the Post & Page edit Administration Panels are hidden by default. Custom Fields are hidden by default if they have not been used before, so you **will need to enable them first**.
2. Add a custom option with name 'sticky' and value set to 'true'
